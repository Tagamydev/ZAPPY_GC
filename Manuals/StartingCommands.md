Absolutely — let’s break it down with **actual examples** and what each command **means**, especially for initializing a **graphic client** for the Zappy protocol.

---

## ✅ 1. **Graphic Client Connects to Server**

**What client sends:**

```
GRAPHIC\n
```

**Why:** This tells the server: *“I'm a graphic monitor client, not a player.”*

---

## 📥 2. **Server Responds with Initial Game State**

This is a sequence of commands that the server **sends to your client** to tell it about the current world.

Let’s walk through an example.

---

### 🗺️ `msz X Y` — Map Size

```
msz 10 10
```

**Meaning:** The map is 10 tiles wide and 10 tiles high.

---

### ⏱️ `sgt T` — Time Unit

```
sgt 100
```

**Meaning:** One unit of time = 100 ms (used for pacing animations, timed events).

---

### 🧱 `bct X Y q0 q1 q2 q3 q4 q5 q6` — Tile Content

This is sent once **for every tile** in the map.

```
bct 0 0 1 0 0 2 0 1 0
bct 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
...
```

**Order of resources (indices):**

| Index | Name       |
| ----- | ---------- |
| 0     | Nourriture |
| 1     | Linemate   |
| 2     | Deraumère  |
| 3     | Sibur      |
| 4     | Mendiane   |
| 5     | Phiras     |
| 6     | Thystame   |

**Example interpretation:**

```
bct 0 0 1 0 0 2 0 1 0
```

At tile (0,0):

* 1 food
* 2 Sibur (index 3)
* 1 Phiras (index 5)

### 👥 `tna N` — Team Name

Sent once per team:

```
tna TeamRocket
tna TeamValor
```

**Use:** Store these for player-team mapping.

---

### 🧍 `pnw #n X Y O L N` — Player Info

Sent once per connected player:

```
pnw 1 3 4 2 1 TeamRocket
pnw 2 5 7 1 2 TeamValor
```

**Means:**

* Player ID 1 is at tile (3,4), facing **East** (O=2), level 1, from team "TeamRocket".
* Player ID 2 is at tile (5,7), facing **North** (O=1), level 2, from team "TeamValor".

**Orientations:**

| Number | Direction |
| ------ | --------- |
| 1      | North     |
| 2      | East      |
| 3      | South     |
| 4      | West      |

---

### 🥚 `enw #e #n X Y` — Egg

Sent once per existing egg:

```
enw 5 1 2 3
```

**Means:** Egg ID `5` was laid by player `1` at tile (2,3).

---

## 🧩 After Initialization...

Now you have the full **initial game state**. The server will now begin to send **live updates**, like:

* `ppo 1 4 4 2` → player moved to (4,4)
* `pgt 1 1` → player picked up Linemate
* `pic 4 4 2 1 2 3` → incantation started at (4,4)
* `plv 1 2` → player leveled up
* etc.

You must:

* Store all players, tiles, and resources in memory
* Update positions, inventories, and map contents dynamically as messages arrive
* Trigger animations on state changes

---

## 🎮 Summary: Example Init Sequence

```
CLIENT ➜ GRAPHIC\n

SERVER ➜
msz 10 10
sgt 100
bct 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0
bct 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0
...
bct 9 9 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
tna RedTeam
tna BlueTeam
pnw 1 2 3 1 1 RedTeam
pnw 2 6 7 2 2 BlueTeam
enw 5 1 3 3
```

This is everything your **graphic client** needs to display the world. From here, just listen for real-time updates.

Would you like me to give you a small working **mockup or pseudocode** of how to parse this initialization step and store the game state?
